# Project Plan: Documentation Consolidation

This plan tracks the atomic tasks for transitioning to the GSD documentation structure.

## Active Planning Lock: [2026-02-13]

### [DOCUMENTATION] [Cleaning up legacy documentation]

- [x] Merge `STANDALONE_USAGE.md` into `SPEC.md`.
- [x] Merge `RECONCILIATION_WALKTHROUGH.md` and `OOXML_ARCHITECTURE.md` into `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- [x] Generate `ROADMAP.md` from `WORD_JS_API_DEPENDENCIES.md`.
- [x] Prepare `STATE.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `SUMMARY.md`.
- [x] Delete `OOXML_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- [x] Delete `RECONCILIATION_WALKTHROUGH.md`.
- [x] Delete `STANDALONE_USAGE.md`.
- [x] Delete `WORD_JS_API_DEPENDENCIES.md`.

**Verification**:
- Verify all links in `SPEC.md` work.
- Verify `pkg:package` usage examples are preserved.
- Verify migration phases are documented in `ROADMAP.md`.
